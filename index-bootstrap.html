                <p>I began this migration to a full stack designer from a background in graphic design.</p>
        
                <p>I like small snippets of things that by themselves arent much, but when all the pieces are put together, you have something spectacular. Thats why I Iike quilting, stained glass, and yes - coding. Its not only aesthetically a work of art, but servers a function as well. I think that makes the world a more enjoyable place to live.</p>
                
                <p>Prior to entering the coding program, I worked in a graphic design position where I designed fundraising collateral for school sports and other non-profit organizations. While in this role I used Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. Although my recent work experience has been in graphic design, I've always been fascinated by code and seeing how things work. For that reason, I enrolled in the University of Arizona coding program, to help me develop the coding skills that would best compliment my work in design.</p>

                <!-- <p>While in the program I am acquiring skills to become a full stack designer working on skills that build on each other. One project in particular that enjoyed was a React project called "The React Clicky Game." With this project I not only got to make a responsive memory game using React and JSX, but I got to use my graphic design skills sizing and editing the images and then formatting the page using HTML, Boostrap, and CSS.</p> -->

                <!-- >>>TALK ABOUT PROJECT 2 HERE, CSS ANIMATION, GRADIENT AND HOW ITS A BLEND OF BOTH SKILLS -->

                <p>Now as a soon to be graduate, I am excited about the road ahead and the opportunity to leverage both my graphic design and coding skills, proving myself to be the multifaceted and well-rounded developer companies seek. With my eye for layout and design I hope to bring a unique perspective that will allow me to continue honing my skills as a developer, but also becoming more proficient in my back end abilities.</p>

                <!-- <p>Ultimately my goal is to work for a progressive company, that fosters corporate diversity and a productive and supportive company culture, committed to the development of its employees.</p> -->
